# Joshs-Social-Network-API

## Description
This API allows users to be created, and deleted. It allows users to comment, or "thought", and react to those thoughts -- theirs, or others, and also allows users to edit their own thoughts, and reactions. It also allows users to add and delete other users from their friends list as well. It is a database that creates and holds new data as it is added, deleted, or updated.

## Installation
Clone the repository, navigate to the folder that contains the "package.json" file using your terminal and type "npm i" to install the dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you should ensure that you have MongoDB and MongoDB Compass installed and configured. Next, type "npm start" into the terminal, and now the database should be up and ready to be interacted with!

## Usage
Without a front-end to go with it, you need to use Insomnia to interact with it. Which you will see in the youtube video that displays its' functionality.
